# Hello!

My name is Henry Odza, and I am a senior at Case Western Reserve
University studying computer science with a minor in history. I find myself spending my time learning and reading. 

I like to explore things and learn why they are the way they are. This not only
applies to software, but the systems that make up our world and society, as well
as the places that we live in. If you ever find yourself wanting a tour of
CWRU's odd spots, its steam tunnels, liminal hallways and staircases, roofs that
you probably shouldn't have access to, or just some fun history tidbits about Case and Cleveland. Then I am your man. 

At CWRU, I am involved in several organizations. I am the treasurer for
SunriseCWRU, a climate advocacy student group on campus. Sunrise is a national
organization focused on building strong communities to fight climate change. At
Case, we pushed the administration to divest from fossil fuels. And right now we
are working on getting more native plants on our campus, rather than the
Kentucky Bluegrass that is so prevalent, not only at Case but all across the
U.S. It's not even from Kentucky! Its an invasive plant from Europe and North
Asia. 

Over the past year I have fallen down the Linux and open source rabbit hole. I started by putting Mint on my little sisters old laptop that she no longer used in January 2025. Over that summer I installed NixOS on my primary laptop and have not looked back since. Since then I have also been using tools like Neovim and Hyprland, which has given me a deep appreciation for learning the tools that I am using. These bleeding edge, endlessly configurable software have given me countless opportunities to procrastinate my work in a somewhat productive manner by learning more about them.

My love for open source led me to CWRUnix, the Linux club on campus, this past fall. We are a growing enthusiastic community centered on Linux and all things FOSS. While I have no empirical evidence, I think that CWRU might have the highest concentration of NixOS users in an undergraduate population. There's like 20 of us in CWRUnix! In January 2026, I joined the exec board of CWRUnix as the vibes manager.
